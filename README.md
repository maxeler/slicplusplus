SLiC++
======

C++ bindings for the SLiC dynamic interface.

Usage
-----

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that this code is very poorly tested and undocumented
(i.e. it may not even compile). It is provided only for illustrative purposes.
There are many SLiC functions missing. Any suggestions for improvements (or patches!) welcome.

This is a pure header library... simply include the `include` directory in your compile command.
See `tests` for example usage.

N.B. This library requires a C++11 compiler (which is not installed by default on e.g. CentOS6).
